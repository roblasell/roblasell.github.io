hours spent working on this project to date: 13


things implemented as I would like them to be:

	- this README
	- resume.html/resume.css
	- bio.html/bio.css
	- most of index.html/index.css

things not fully implemented, for future consideration:

	- resizing index.html elements in different sized browsers

thanks to Will Clarkson for helping me understand a few things
about HTML and CSS, and to Natar for help with CSS fiddling!
