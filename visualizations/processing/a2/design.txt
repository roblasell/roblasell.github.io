Viz Assignment 2: Animated Transitions
Team Members: Steph Cleland & Rob Lasell

To improve the design of our graphs and transitions, we created a 
gradient of colors to visually distinguish the data points, which 
helps the user keep track of distinct data points during transitions,
especially in the transition from bar to pie, and back.

Additionally, we made the pie chart and bar chart highlight-able and
able to display a tool-tip containting data about that bar/pie slice 
as the mouse pointer passes over them. We elected not to make the line 
graph highlight-able, given that that is not the normal way one would 
interact with a line graph. We believe this feature increases 
useability and understanding of the graphs and data.

For our transition from bar to pie, we made it clear that 
the height of the bar maps to the percentage of the pie chart. By 
moving the bars into a circle and then rotating them in to form the pie 
chart, it very clear what the mapping between the two is. In addition, 
our final transition into the pie chart, where each pie slice is 
revealed, is not only fun, but also cool! We're very proud of it.
