Viz Assignment 1: Squarified Treemap
Team Members: Steph Cleland & Rob Lasell

We used color to further clarify the structure of the tree to the human 
eye. We accomplished this by setting a color as the color of the root 
canvas, and setting a darker color as the color of the leaves, with all 
intermediate canvases getting progressively darker to create a natural 
progression. Additionally, we made our treemap display data about the nodes 
(the id and value) as the mouse pointer passes over them. Both of these 
changes help a user interpret the data more easily.

We also attempted to modify our treemap to accept other types of data; 
specifically, we used world population data such that each country was 
represented as a node whose size is given by the total population of the 
country. This is interesting because it is a way to visualize population 
data that differs from traditional visualizations of that data, which tend 
to use color gradiation to represent the population on a world map. Because 
we did not realize that 2 versions could be submitted, we added a boolean 
flag that must be set in order to use data (like our world population 
data) that is separated by a colon instead of a space.
